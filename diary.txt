Diary Entries:

27/10/2022: - Begun to research into the different types of Machine Learning Algotithms
            - looked in K-Nearest Neighbour, how it works and how to implement it

28/10/2022: - Installed scikit-learn 
            - Added dataset to repositry

01/11/2022: - Started coding to Jupyter Notebook - so that all data can be visualised/compiled in one place
            - Reasearched the seaborn library to potentially visualise data on informative statistical graphic
            - Also reasearched Pandas library - to potentially analyse datasets
            - split the data set using scikit-Learn
            - Created a method to workout the Euclidean distance between two points
            - Created a method to work out the KNN

03/11/2022: - Trying to convert .csv file into a .txt file - because reading the data set file by row has become difficult
            - Created a sort method to sort out the distances in ascending order
            - Used numpy's genfromtxt instead, but dataset is too large and takes too long to process

04/11/2022: - Broke down dataset into first 200 entries, because dataset is too large to process
            - Created method for 1NN to test
            - Numpy's genfromtxt doesn't like the engineSize and tax variables - so I have left them out for the time being
            

05/11/2022: - Created a prediction method to predict the price of the cars
            - Results from prediction method are returning in an unwanted format
            - Using Pandas library to read from library - for effiency and better readings from the dataset
            - Created a seaborn heatmap to visualise dataset
            - Looked into Seaborn's distplots graph
