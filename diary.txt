Diary Entries:

27/10/2022: - Begun to research into the different types of Machine Learning Algotithms
            - looked in K-Nearest Neighbour, how it works and how to implement it

28/10/2022: - Installed scikit-learn 
            - Added dataset to repositry

01/11/2022: - Started coding to Jupyter Notebook - so that all data can be visualised/compiled in one place
            - Reasearched the seaborn library to potentially visualise data on informative statistical graphic
            - Also reasearched Pandas library - to potentially analyse datasets
            - split the data set using scikit-Learn
            - Created a method to workout the Euclidean distance between two points
            - Created a method to work out the KNN

03/11/2022: - Trying to convert .csv file into a .txt file - because reading the data set file by row has become difficult
            - Created a sort method to sort out the distances in ascending order
            - Used numpy's genfromtxt instead, but dataset is too large and takes too long to process

04/11/2022: - Cleaned the data: getting rid of model, transmission and fuel type.
            - Broke down dataset into first 200 entries, because dataset is too large to process
            - Created method for 1NN to test
            - Numpy's genfromtxt doesn't like the engineSize and tax variables - so I have left them out for the time being      

05/11/2022: - Created a prediction method to predict the price of the cars
            - Results from prediction method are returning in an unwanted format
            - Using Pandas library to read from library - for effiency and better readings from the dataset
            - Created a seaborn heatmap to visualise dataset
            - Looked into Seaborn's distplots graph

17/11/2022: - Began writing the evaluation method for KNN - is currenlty suited for classification, not regression
            - Began work writing interim report.

18/11/2022: - Began writing the methodology in the interim report

21/11/2022: - Begun writting decription of KNN algorithm to Interim report

23/11/2022: - Begun coding the decsion tree algorithm: imported & split data, method using scikit-learn, entropy method
            - Begun writting decription of decision algorithm to Interim report
            - Attempted to vidsualise the decsion tree

25/11/2022: - Normalised data for KNN
            - Added preprocessing and normalization to Interim report
            - Removed unnecessary .txt files

26/11/2022: - Fixed issued with reading normalised data
            - Added code examples to interim report

29/11/2022: - Completed the evaluation method for KNN, using RMSE

30/11/2022: - Changed how I reduced data set to increase accuracy by 0.3 at peak
            - Used Pandas feature "get_dummies()" to generate dummy variables for model, transmission and fuel type
            - Created a user input to get prediction of their own car

01/12/2022: - Removed "get_dummies()" and replaced with "LabelEncoder()"
            - Completed user prediction input - fully working

02/12/2022: - Fixed an issue with prediction, where predictions were completely wrong - fixed by normalising user input


05/12/2022: - Worked on decision tree algorithm - understanding what each method does
            - Calculated how many times euclidean distance is calculated and how long a single prediction takes
            - Described my KNN algorithm code in the interim report

06/12/2022: - Created Decision tree class
                - Initialised values
                - Created fit method to put features and label together
                - Created start of build tree method

07/12/2022: - Added to build tree method
            - Created method to find the best split
            - Created a method to find split tree into branches
            - Created entropy method to calculate entropy of a node
            - Created method to calculate information gain
