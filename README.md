# Final Year Project

The goal of this project is to use ML algorithms 
to find the most suitable algorithm able to carry 
out the most accurate predictions, as well as providing 
the best performance and overall efficiency, by comparing 
their benchmark data. With this project I will be applying at 
least three different supervised machine learning algorithms; 
consisting of logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour and 
decision trees. To analyse these algorithms, I will perform a 
regression analysis and cross-validation of each algorithm used, 
in order to find which provides the best performance. To train 
the algorithms, I am going to use a dataset, last updated in 
2020, that has the selling price and features of over 100,000 
pre-owned cars.

- There is a folder called 'Jupyter Notebook' that contains only ipynb files, to provide a clear and well structed demonstartion of the code.
- There is also a file called UI_interface 'UI_interface' that you can run to use the GUI.
